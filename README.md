# StarWars API Demo Application

## Purpose

This application demonstrates a Next.js application that uses a variety of frameworks,
most notably, GraphQL, to search the StarWars database for characters. Styling is
via TailwindCSS and the GraphQL server is utilizing the micro apollo server.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**NOTE:** Do pay attention to output of `yarn dev`, however as it will incrementally try port numbers
above 3000 if say, port 3000, is already in use by another service.
